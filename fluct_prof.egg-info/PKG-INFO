# Single particle profiler
## Software for analysis of the intensity traces obtained by FCS-like microscopy setup.

What can it do:

1. Fitting of correlation curves for FCS
2. Intensity trace analysis with isolation of peaks in dual color experiment
3. Nano-flow cytometry adapted for measurements of fluorescence intensity for single particles
4. Biophysical profiling: characterization of membrane fluidity when used in combination with ratiometric probes
