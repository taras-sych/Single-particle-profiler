# Single particle profiler
## High throughpu analysis of freely diffusing fluorescent particles.

What can it do:

1.  Nano-flow cytometry adapted for measurements of fluorescence intensity for single particles
   - Intensity trace analysis with isolation of peaks in dual color experiment
   - Dye loading in Liposomes
   - Antibody binding to Virus-Like Particles
   - RNA loading into Lipid Nano-Particles
2. Biophysical profiling:
   - Characterization of membrane fluidity
   - in Lipoproteins
   - in Liposomes
   - in Extracellular vesicles
   - in Virus-Like Particles
   - in Lipid Nano-Particles
3. Fitting of correlation curves for FCS
